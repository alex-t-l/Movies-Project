# Movies-Project

This movies project represents a rental movie store that wants to automate their inventory tracking system. There are three genres, Comedy, Drama, and Classic. 
The program keeps track of borrowed and returned items for each customer, also the inventory and history of the customers. The inventory is initialized from a text file, and the customers
are initialized from a. customer file, then the commands from the commands file.
